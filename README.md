git-marge: Marge just thinks marges are neat
=======

`git-marge` allows you to recover when you've accidentally mistyped `git merge`,
and instead typed `git marge`.  Normally, Git will tell you that you've made
a mistake:

```
% git marge branch-a
git: 'marge' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
```

But with `git-marge`, your file will still be added to the index, but also Marge Simpson will appear in your terminal to tell you what she thinks of merges:


### Install
Clone locally and then simply mv or cp git-marge into your .local/bin folder (or whatever local bin folder you prefer)
